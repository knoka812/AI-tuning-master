# AI-tuning-master
Deep learning hyperparameter tuning master built on the ERNIE model

---


## Project Overview

This project aims to help users learn and solve problems related to AI model tuning in a professional yet humorous way. It leverages LangChain for document processing, ERNIE for text embeddings, and Milvus as a vector database to enable efficient knowledge retrieval and interactive Q&A.

## Features

- Loads and splits a Chinese deep learning tuning playbook (docx format)
- Converts text to vector embeddings using ERNIE
- Stores and searches knowledge in Milvus vector database
- Provides an interactive agent for continuous dialogue and Q&A
- Answers are professional, easy to understand, and humorous

## Main Technologies

- LangChain (document loading, splitting)
- ERNIE (text embedding)
- Milvus (vector database)
- OpenAI API (chat model)
- Python

## Usage

1. Install dependencies listed in the notebook.
2. Prepare your API keys and configure the environment.
3. Run the notebook step by step to load documents, build the vector database, and start the interactive agent.
4. Ask questions about model tuning and get professional, fun answers!
